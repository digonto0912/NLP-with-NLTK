#  Natural Language Processing (NLP) with NLTK

This project demonstrates the application of Natural Language Processing (NLP) using the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) library. It involves processing and analyzing large text datasets to extract meaningful information and insights. The project includes various NLP tasks such as tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition (NER), sentiment analysis, and text classification.

Key features:

- Text Preprocessing: Tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, and removal of stop words to clean the text data.
- Part-of-Speech Tagging: Identifying the syntactic categories of words within sentences.
- Named Entity Recognition (NER): Recognizing and classifying entities such as names, dates, and locations in the text.
- Sentiment Analysis: Analyzing the sentiment of text data to categorize it into positive, negative, or neutral.
- Text Classification: Categorizing text into predefined classes using machine learning techniques.
- Technologies Used:
 -- Python
 -- NLTK library
 -- Pandas (for data handling)
 -- Scikit-learn (for machine learning models)

This project showcases fundamental NLP tasks, providing insights into text mining and machine learning applications in the field of natural language understanding.
